/*
 * android/media/AudioTrack - where the game's mixer output goes.
 *
 * Modern Combat 3 does its own mixing and hands finished PCM to Android one
 * buffer at a time through AudioTrack.write. That makes this class the entire
 * audio output path: nothing else in the binary opens a device.
 *
 * The overload matters and cost this port a silent run. Android has a byte[]
 * form and a short[] form of write(), and they count differently - bytes for
 * one, *samples* for the other. This engine uses the byte[] form, and the
 * donor proves it: "([BII)I" is the only one of the two descriptors present in
 * libModernCombat3.so's .rodata. Registering only "([SII)I" produced
 *
 *     Class AudioTrack does not have method write([BII)I.
 *
 * which is not a quiet degradation - GetMethodID answers NULL, the engine
 * writes into nothing, and its mixer either stalls waiting for a queue that
 * never drains or spins feeding a device that never consumes. Both are
 * registered now; the short[] entry doubles its count before queueing, because
 * SDL_QueueAudio takes bytes and registering one implementation under both
 * descriptors would play half the audio as a stutter.
 *
 * Two more things about this class are already known and are recorded here
 * rather than rediscovered:
 *
 *   - write([SII)I is the method that first hit the ldrd alignment fault
 *     portbase fixes at the va_list template (jni/jni_internals.h). It is the
 *     first method in any of these ports with two adjacent int arguments. That
 *     fix is in the base; nothing is needed here.
 *
 *   - The engine calls getMinBufferSize before it constructs anything and
 *     sizes its own ring from the answer. Returning 0 or a nonsense value is
 *     not a quiet degradation - it is a division by zero inside the mixer.
